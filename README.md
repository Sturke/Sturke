### Fun Fact:
German chocolate cake was invented in Texas

found at Reader's Digest https://www.rd.com/list/interesting-facts/

The “German” part of German chocolate cake comes from an American man—not a European country. Specifically, it’s named after Sam German, who in 1852 created the formula for a mild dark baking chocolate bar for Baker’s Chocolate Company, which was subsequently named Baker’s German’s Sweet Chocolate. Fast-forward to June 13, 1957. The Dallas Morning Star published the recipe for the cake, invented and submitted by a reader identified as Mrs. George Clay, according to What’s Cooking America.

### I Am Currently:
(in December 2022) reviewing freecodecamp lessons and finishing up my Responsive Web Design certification. I'm also working to configure a workflow that I like to use GitHub on my MacBook. I had installed Atom as my code editor last year on my new (New in 2020) Macbook. I just found that it was developed and maintained by GitHub, but soon (Dec 2022) GitHub will stop support of Atom and GitHub recommends Visual Studio Code. I suppose that reveals how long I've been out of the loop. Microsoft bought GitHub in 2018. So, I'm trying to iron out that workflow change now.
