âš¡Fun Fact: When you reach 50 years old you are allowed to contribute $7000 per year to a Roth IRA rather than the standard $6000. That's just $134/wk and I have nearly accomplished this for 2021. Yay!

ðŸ”­I am currently (in November 2021) reviewing freecodecamp work and finishing up my Responsive Web Design certification. I'm also working to configure a workflow that I like to use GitHub on my MacBook. I just saw a tutorial for a local WordPress development environment called Local by Flywheel that I'm anxious to test out.
