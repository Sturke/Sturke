### ⚡Fun Fact: 
<hr />
German chocolate cake was invented in Texas<br />

found at Reader's Digest https://www.rd.com/list/interesting-facts/

The “German” part of German chocolate cake comes from an American man—not a European country. Specifically, it’s named after Sam German, who in 1852 created the formula for a mild dark baking chocolate bar for Baker’s Chocolate Company, which was subsequently named Baker’s German’s Sweet Chocolate. Fast-forward to June 13, 1957. The Dallas Morning Star published the recipe for the cake, invented and submitted by a reader identified as Mrs. George Clay, according to What’s Cooking America.

### 🔭I am currently: Working to understand the workflow to get sites pushed to Github and deployed on Netlify. I started with the Netlify Feature Tour and got that working. But, suddenly I found myself lost because the Netlify CLI is so slick, it installed all kinds of files that I dont yet understand. So, I found a simpler template to create a "Simple Landing Page with 11ty". Again, a super amazing CLI install and I understoon very little of what is going on under the hood. So, now Im working to build an 11ty site from scratch. So far, my new build is working and I have Tailwind CSS working as well. Again, Tailwind with another amazing CLI.

 (in December 2022) reviewing freecodecamp lessons and finishing up my Responsive Web Design certification.<br /> 
 I'm also working to configure a workflow that I like to use GitHub on my MacBook. I had installed Atom as my code editor last year on my new (New in 2020) Macbook. I just found that it was developed and maintained by GitHub, but soon (Dec 2022) GitHub will stop support of Atom and GitHub recommends Visual Studio Code. So, I'm trying to iron out that workflow change now.

### Really Cool Tip: 
 <hr />
 I Just Learned DEC 3, 2022 from Ryan Hayden at our FreeCodeCamp MeetUp:
While viewing a GitHub repository in a browser, hit the (.) period key. It should open Visual Studio Code in the browser and you can edit right there, Holy Smoke! Amazing!
