âš¡Fun Fact: 

ðŸ”­I am currently (in November 2022) reviewing freecodecamp work and finishing up my Responsive Web Design certification. I'm also working to configure a workflow that I like to use GitHub on my MacBook. I just saw a tutorial for a local WordPress development environment called Local by Flywheel that I'm anxious to test out. I've chosen Atom as my code editor. I experimented with Atom several years ago. I just found that it integrates well with GitHub. So, I'm trying to iron out that workflow now.
