### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**Sturke/Sturke** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...
-->
Fun Fact: When you reach 50 years old you are allowed to contribute $7000 per year to a Roth IRA rather than the standard $6000. That's just $134/wk and I have nearly accomplished this for 2021. Yay!

I am currently (in August 2021) working to update my github pages website as a <a href="https://sturke.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">portfolio website</a>. I am reviewing my work at FreeCodeCamp and I am preparing to make a move into web development by 2022. I want to work from home and become more independent from my typical 9-5 job.

I just learned that GitHub does not allow target="_blank" to open a new tab from my ReadMe. So, I guess I'll need to provide a link on my linked pages to get back to my github profile easily.
