### ⚡Fun Fact: 
<hr />
German chocolate cake was invented in Texas<br />

found at Reader's Digest https://www.rd.com/list/interesting-facts/

The “German” part of German chocolate cake comes from an American man—not a European country. Specifically, it’s named after Sam German, who in 1852 created the formula for a mild dark baking chocolate bar for Baker’s Chocolate Company, which was subsequently named Baker’s German’s Sweet Chocolate. Fast-forward to June 13, 1957. The Dallas Morning Star published the recipe for the cake, invented and submitted by a reader identified as Mrs. George Clay, according to What’s Cooking America.

### 🔭I am currently:  
<hr />
 (in February 2023) Working to understand the workflow to get sites pushed to Github and deployed on Netlify. I started with the Netlify Feature Tour and got that working. But, suddenly I found myself lost because the Netlify CLI is so slick, it installed all kinds of files that I dont yet understand. So, I found a simpler template to create a "Simple Landing Page with 11ty". Again, a super amazing CLI install and I understoon very little of what is going on under the hood. So, now Im working to build an 11ty site from scratch. So far, my new build is working and I have Tailwind CSS working as well. Again, Tailwind with another amazing CLI.
