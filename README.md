### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**Sturke/Sturke** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

âš¡Fun Fact: When you reach 50 years old you are allowed to contribute $7000 per year to a Roth IRA rather than the standard $6000. That's just $134/wk and I have nearly accomplished this for 2021. Yay!

ðŸ”­I am currently (in October 2021) working to update my github pages website as a <a href="https://sturke.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">portfolio website</a>. I am reviewing my work at FreeCodeCamp and I am preparing to make a move into web development by 2022. I want to work from home and become more independent from my day job that is not in this field. I'm working to refinish my wife's office so she has a finished work space and also, I'm feverishly  trying to get outdoor gardening and grass seed projects finished before the snow flies. All of this time sensitive, climate/seasonal sensitive work must be done now.
