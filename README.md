Fun Fact: When you reach 50 years old you are allowed to contribute $7000 per year to a Roth IRA rather than the standard $6000. That's just $134/wk and I have nearly accomplished this for 2021. Yay!

I am currently (in August 2021) working to update my github pages website as a <a href="https://sturke.github.io/">portfolio website</a>. I am reviewing my work at FreeCodeCamp and I am preparing to make a move into web development by 2022. I want to work from home and become more independent from my typical 9-5 job.
